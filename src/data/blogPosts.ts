I wanted to share that I lost a dear friend this year at the young age of 51 who battled cancer for several years, leaving a wonderful wife and two loving children, a freshman and junior in college. Unfortunately, my story is not too uncommon. If you speak to enough people, one would come across a similarly tragic story, and some have come close to losing a loved one. In reflecting on this year, I came across this inscription, that I sent a book to him - "The Boy, the mole, the fox and the horse"

Dear Kevin, You have had a long-fought journey, and this journey is continuing, because your life will continue. I thought this book would be helpful with this journey. My niece gave this book to me, she knows that I enjoy things that make me view life in different ways and make me think. I hope this book provides inspiration and strength as you soldier on. But does this journey need to be a fight, do you need to be a soldier? One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things - it is our choice. Sometimes just getting up and carrying on is magnificent. When the big things feel out of control...focus on what you love right under your nose, your amazing family and your friends who love you!!! Life is all about mindset. As you read through this book, hopefully these thoughts will be uplifting. The ending of the book shares that this book is about friendship and indeed Renee and our family will always be by your and your family's side. It is an honor to call you, my friend!

Our family will be forever thankful he was a part of our lives.

Recently I had the opportunity to be one of the speakers in an Annual Leadership Retreat held in Deer Valley, Utah. It was an amazing group. The attendees were all Pride Institute Alumnus practicing and retired. What a beautiful place! It was a perfect setting for the featured speaker, Kristen Ulmer, who is the author of the "Art of Fear" and was the number one Big Mountain Skier for 12 years. She addressed fear and how different people manage it. She shared the exercises of really understanding people and how we can all interact better with our patients, team, friends and family. Kristen shares with the group that treatment for anxiety disorders is more resistance. These are not mental health issues, she expresses. Furthermore, these anxiety disorders can manifest itself into physical ailments. We should not try to suppress or bury fear. If you are in flow with your fear than you can be in flow with yourself. The awful feeling we associate with fear is not fear it is the feeling of the resistance. Our society loves to fear shame. We need to embrace fear and work with it. How does fear factor in your personal life, with your patients and with your team? It is too large of a concept to address in this article, but it should give you pause and a time of self-reflection. It was an amazing talk. If you are interested in attending the next one, please reach out to me.

I also had the honor to speak to the dental students at the Dugoni School of Dentistry at the start of the school year. The topic was advice on navigating dental school and career paths after dental school. I truly enjoy interacting and presenting to these groups. It was wonderful to see the number of Freshman students, as well as each class being well represented. The group was engaging, asked very thoughtful questions and their curiosity and zest for knowledge was off the charts. They have their whole career ahead of them. Their energy, excitement, and fear of what their future holds was palpable. I highlighted my former Dean, Dr. Art Dugoni's, message of be involved, be a leader, and give back to our profession. As organized dentistry is facing a variety of challenges it is now more important than ever to be part of a movement to be involved. As we reflect on our own blessings in life, we can show our gratitude now by paying forward. There are so many opportunities to be involved. Many hands make light work! I know the individuals reading this article echo my sentiment and charge. It is us that need to get the word out! I am thankful to my profession, to the San Mateo County Dental Society and its awesome team and constituents, and to all who have touched my life! Wishing you all a very joyous holiday season!

    title: "Work Staff Shortages in Dentistry... What can we do?",

    content: `I get calls, texts, and questions almost every day complaining, asking questions and conveying concerns about work staff shortages in the dental profession. Questions such as "Do you know any dental assistants looking for work?" "It is so hard to get great candidates for our position" "Where are all the quality team members?"

<img src="/lovable-uploads/cd55db20-adc0-4a27-a6e9-2ca8635b58d1.png" alt="Professional dental team of three healthcare workers in scrubs standing together in a modern dental office" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

The answer is, I don't know anyone, and this is the state of the profession. They simply aren't out there as much, so you can stop expecting a quick fix. Specifically, the dental assisting workforce has been shattered by the pandemic, and the situation isn't going to get better anytime soon. It will be years before dental practices recuperate and can find dental team members to round out their teams.

Many older professionals decided during the pandemic to retire and/or cut back on their workload. I spoke to a dentist recently wanting to sell his practice. In getting to know his practice, I asked him to share with me information about his team. His response was I work alone. I queried him further to clarify his response and he said, "I have no employees". What!??? The same goes for many other dental professionals-sales forces, college and trade school instructors, office managers, and hygienists. We experienced a mass exodus, much of it to retirement. Those who stayed moved to the next level to fill vacancies and parted ways with some offices to advance their careers in another office. That left many practices short on people, with no way to find experienced individuals because they're few and far between, and good employers are doing what they can to hang onto their good ones. In the midst of it all, many dental assisting schools closed, which helped lead to one of the biggest shortages of oral healthcare workers in a very long time.

What can you do about this situation?

We are a resilient profession! You start from scratch. For instance, visit a local restaurant and find the waiter or waitress who hustles, and hire them. Visit your bank and find an employee who smiles and goes above and beyond to help you and hire them. Take a look at your patient base, find the patient everyone loves to see, and hire them. You need to look for good people and then train them! The days of interviewing, then having a second interview, then having a working interview are over. If you are lucky enough that a candidate shows up, they present well, they are trainable/coachable, are well spoken, and appear to have a "reasonable" work ethic. Hire them on the spot!!!

Is all of this a big pain?

Yes, but it's what we need to do to keep moving forward. Training from scratch is not ideal because I know everyone in the office is busy, but what else can we do? The inconvenience pays off in the long run.

When you bring in someone, don't overload them. Set them up for success. Be patient! If they're an assistant, start them with small tasks in sterilization and have them shadow. You will have to lengthen your appointments to assure a positive working environment. This will allow you to explain the procedure and debrief the new team member about the appointment and about what is about to happen. The post appointment is needed to review and reflect on what went well and what to improve upon. If it's a new front desk person, find something they can accomplish quickly so they feel productive, then you can add more tasks as people grow confident. Don't overwhelm and overload anyone with information too quickly.

Have constant "growth meetings" and check-ins. These interactions are designed to be purposeful, empowering and educational. This will provide opportunities to assure a successful assimilation to your practice and procedures.

I often hear from team members who say they are worked so hard and get few to no breaks and no lunch. Understandable, because generally these individuals are thrown in to an existing tough situation, most often alone with no other team or dentist support. Basically, a sink or swim mentality. They generally sink, at no fault of their own. Don't put your team through this because everyone needs a break, everybody needs support, everybody needs the feeling of success and accomplishment. We all need a few minutes each day to breathe and compose ourselves. We all need clear guidelines and clear expectations to be successful.

Have written protocols/SOPs (standard operating protocols) that team members can refer to so they don't feel lost and worried about asking too many questions. If instructions are written out, the team can refer to this often and work independently. Written protocols are the best way to keep your team on task. Team members need to know what to do and when to do it. Written protocols are the best way to convey how you want your business run.

Your protocols should be clear and concise, not too fancy or full of garbage, just easy to read. They're a huge boost for the newbies as well as for the veterans who may think they know what you want. Protocols keep team members on the same page at all times. Have your team cross trained, many hands make light work!

Finally, value your team! If they're good, hang on to them. Show appreciation, and by all means, be kind. Sounds simple, unfortunately it is not common. Team members want to work where they're valued and respected. Show your team and coworkers how much you appreciate them, and they will stay! By following these suggestions, hopefully the dental staffing shortage will not have a huge impact on you.

Remember, knowledge is power. Please email me at dentalstrategies@gmail.com for any questions. I would be happy to schedule a call.`

Part 2: Navigating Dental Transitions: The Importance of Advisors to ensure a Seamless Process

Transitioning a dental practice can be a complex and daunting process. It is one of the most significant career moves a dentist will make. However, with the right advisors/team and a well-structured plan, a smooth transition can be achieved. This article will outline the key advisors needed for a dental transition, potential pitfalls to be aware of, and the method employed by the Dental Strategies team, which focuses on a thorough assessment, a customized roadmap, and ongoing guidance to ensure a seamless transition. The goal is to provide a personalized process for the dentist, their patients, dental team, and family.

I. The Advisors Needed for Your Dental Transition

A. Dental Practice Transitions Consultant. A dental practice transitions consultant plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition process. With their expertise and experience, they evaluate the practice's value, effectively market it, and connect dentists with potential buyers or sellers. Their extensive knowledge of the dental industry and their network of contacts make them invaluable in finding the right match for the practice. They serve as the quarterback of the transition team.

B. Accountant and Financial Advisor. Engaging the services of a qualified accountant and financial advisor is essential during a dental transition. They assess the practice's financial aspects, analyze tax implications, evaluate profitability, and provide guidance on structuring the deal to maximize financial goals. They also assist in tdeermining the appropriate handling of practice proceeds, ensuring compliance with tax regulations, and minimizing potential tax implications.

C. Legal Counsel. A Dental transition involves intricate legal procedures, contracts, and negotiations. Hiring a dental-specific attorney can protect the dentist's interests, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and provide guidance on legal matters throughout the transition process. It is vital to follow the guidelines set forth by the state dental board to maintain professional and legal compliance during the transition.

II. Potential Pitfalls to Avoid

A. Lack of Proper Assessment. Failing to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the dental practice can lead to inaccurate valuations, unrealistic expectations, and potential litigation. A thorough evaluation should include a financial analysis, patient demographics, operational efficiencies, and practice reputation (goodwill) to determine the practice's true value and growth potential. Detailed practice management reports, profit and loss statements, and tax returns must support these metrics. A poorly prepared packet that over or undervalues the practice or is incomplete, will lower the chances of a successful transition.

B. Inadequate Planning and Execution. Insufficient planning and a lack of a well-defined roadmap can result in a chaotic transition. Without a clear plan in place, important aspects such as patient retention, staff management, and maintaining continuity of care may suffer. Dentists must have a clear understanding of their transition goals and develop a strategic plan to ensure a successful and organized transition process.

C. Failure to Communicate with Stakeholders. Effective communication is vital during a dental transition. Failing to inform and involve key stakeholders, including patients, staff, and suppliers, can lead to uncertainty, mistrust, and potential disruptions to the practice's operations. Timing is critical in when and how to deliver such information. Dentists must carefully plan and execute a communication strategy that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders and ensures a smooth transition.

III. The Dental Strategies Method

A Seamless Transition with Ongoing Guidance. Dental Strategies team understands the intricacies of dental transitions and provides clients with a smooth, seamless, and well-supported experience for clients. Dental Strategies method follows a structured approach.

A. Thorough Assessment. Dental Strategies conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the dental practice, considering financials, operational processes/systems, patient base, goodwill, practice management reports, and growth potential. This thorough assessment serves as the foundation for the transition process, providing vital information that informs the dentist's option and creates a customized "Treatment Plan" with several transition alternatives.

B. Customized Roadmap. Based on the assessment, Dental Strategies develops a tailored roadmap that outlines the necessary steps for a successful transition. This roadmap takes into account the dentist's specific goals, timeline, and individual needs, ensuring a personalized approach that aligns with their objectives.

C. Ongoing Guidance. Recognizing the overwhelming nature of transitions, Dental Strategies experienced advisors work closely with dentists throughout the process, providing ongoing guidance and support at every stage. Regular communication helps address concerns and ensures that dentists make informed decisions that are in line with their objectives and best interests.

D. Protection from Unforeseen Problems. Leveraging their expertise, Dental Strategies anticipates and mitigates potential issues that may arise during the transition. By proactively identifying and addressing challenges, they strive to protect their client's interests and ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruptions.

E. Holding Your Hand Throughout. Dental Strategies understands the emotional and demanding nature of the transition process. Their dedicated team is committed to supporting dentists, providing reassurance, answering questions, and facilitating a seamless transition that prioritizes patient satisfaction, team satisfaction, personal satisfaction, and peace of mind. Recognizing that knowledge gaps can exist, they aim to educate and guide dentists through the entire process.

Please note that the above overview provides only a glimpse into the benefits of having an organized team and plan.

    content: `Creating Culture In Today's Dental Offices

Hello, my name is Michael Njo and I have been a proud member of the SMCDS since 1989. When asked to write for the Mouthpiece, it brought back many memories from the days when I was editor of the Mouthpiece.

When I was injured, I created a consulting company – Dental Strategies which focuses on transitions, management, and legal guidance. It is truly a privilege to write for you this year sharing my experiences.

We as an industry have had a very tumultuous ride. In my care for many practices across the country what I have witnessed is the practices (GP, Endo, Perio, OS, Pedo, and Prosth) that weathered and thrived through the storm had a particular practice culture. I thought it would be appropriate to highlight this practice management touch point - culture. This article will be the 1st in a 4-part series addressing culture.

In all businesses there is a culture. In all societies there is a culture. Culture can be defined as an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. Your practice has created a culture whether purposefully or by evolution. Nonetheless, you have a practice culture. So, what is your practice culture? Can your patients describe it? Can you describe it? Can your team describe it? If not, that is a problem. If you can do all four descriptions, do you all (team) agree with the same description? Do you like the description? If not, that is an even bigger problem.

For decades some dental practices have cared and focused on creating such a culture. Remember the exercises to create mission statements, vision statements, benefit statements, value statements, etc. We took these ideas and techniques from the fortune 100 and 500 companies. However, it was not too long ago that some were criticized for viewing dental practices as a business.

It was ridiculous to try to use best practices from large successful companies. However, the trends have been changing and dental office owners are realizing that they must run their practice not only focusing on the quality of the care, but also utilizing the fundamental mechanics of operating a business. A general dental office overhead in the 1960's was about 35%. A well-run practice overhead is almost double that today. What is your overhead? One of the fundamental aspects of any organization's success is their culture. Early I described the Wikipedia's definition of culture. Let us break it down for your practice. If you are still reading and interested in this article you are way ahead of your peers. Why? You care!!!

So let us gather the ingredients to create a culture that you, your team, and your patient's desire. Those ingredients are in part - Leadership, Values, Principals, Character, Integrity, Team, Mindset, Communication, and Attitude. Like with everything in business, it all starts with Leadership. Leadership can look so many ways. To be a great leader, you just need a few things: a vision of where you want to go, consistency in working towards getting there, and an invitation for others to take that journey with you.

Where do you want to take your practice?
Does everyone around you know?
Are you consistent with your team?
Do they know the standards that their performance is measured against?
Do they know how their contributions contribute to the journey?

Let us first start there. Take some time, anything worth its salt takes time, to answer these questions. Be thoughtful, keep editing it until the next article. You deserve this and so does your team, and your patients.`

Seize your Opportunity, even when you're Transitioning your Practice

After speaking with so many dentists over the last few weeks, I've heard several different attitudes and opinions. The majority of input I have received has been concern, fear, and some negativity.

I want to report that dental transitions, in my opinion, are better than ever. Most strong practices had better profit in 2020 than in the previous year of 2019. Most strong practices are receiving more new patients. The interest in dental care is on the rise. Is/was your practice a strong practice? Let us define in today's marketplace a strong practice.

One of the indicators of a strong practice is a strong recovery. A strong recovery may consist of the following: a solid returning patient base, a robust hygiene program that has hygiene days equal to what they were in 2019, and a fiscal proforma that matches your 2019 revenue.

According to the most recent data, practices are open and experiencing business as usual. Does this sound like your practice? If it doesn't, do not fret. Like in all difficult times, there are general remedies to solve this issue. So, your practice hasn't yet recovered fully? OK, no problem. There could be many reasons why your practice numbers may still be down.

Many doctors used COVID as an opportunity to practice lean and mean, slow down, and never really revamped as the economy reopened. That's ok, but it will have an impact on the value of your practice. Most potential buyers will see that and may be fearful of that potential impact. I work with many lenders; these lenders will review a seller's practice during their underwriting process in many different ways.

During their due diligence, they will check off many boxes. The most popular box was the Delta premier influence on a practice. Now it is the COVID-19 practice recovery box. If this COVID-19 recovery box is not checked off, then the optics for a buyer and lender may be "if the doctor that's been working in this practice for years couldn't rebound, how would I/buyer be able to after the sale?" It's a question that can scare many buyers off and make your practice look less desirable. This, too, can be mitigated.

If you're willing to put in a little more time to get the maximum value for your practice, consider working with a practice management consultant. They will ensure that you're able to get your production and patient base back to pre-pandemic numbers. They can help you fix problem areas and get your practice primed for a comeback.

Whether your practice is booming or at the other end of the spectrum, you must first assess your situation, cultivate your goals, and develop a strategy to transition out of your practice. Dentists are trained diagnosticians. They are skilled at evaluating a situation, gathering the appropriate data, engaging in a thorough dialogue regarding goals, analyze the etiology of problems and situations and then provide a customized treatment plan.

A skilled transition specialist will do exactly just that- treatment plan your transition! During these times, mindset, attitude, and pure grit allow us to navigate these challenges of life. This is especially true when considering or going through the transition of the sale of a practice. Covid-19 had a chilling effect on all practices. During this era, the terms PPP, PPE, etc., are common acronyms, and wearing masks for everyone was customary.

With any crisis, there are great opportunities. Many believe that selling/buying a practice during these times and post these times void the chance for a successful transition of a practice. This is absolutely false.

It is during these times that it is more important than ever to plan for your transition correctly. What does correctly mean? A successful purchase of a practice has many elements. In my opinion, the essential element is the transference of goodwill to replicate and then enhance the business. Goodwill is an intangible asset valued according to the advantage or reputation a business has acquired (over and above its tangible assets). Since COVID, the seller's opportunity is to share their story of how their practice has risen to meet this virus head-on and how their practice sets them apart from others.

This is a classic example of Goodwill. The buyer must be able to successfully parlay this and continue to sustain this environment and culture of the practice. The good news for the buyer is just like in the 1980s, protocols, and supplies are already in place for the buyer to assimilate. Every transition will have its unique makeup and set of circumstances. There are a lot of moving parts. That is why having a great advisory team to join you on this journey is essential.

    title: "Creating Culture In Today's Dental Offices Part II",

    content: `Creating Culture In Today's Dental Offices Part II

Did you survive January? How about last quarter? Statistics have shown that our work force took a substantial amount of time off in the month of January. Practices across the country were also suffering from patient cancellations. Having staffing issues and a dental chair that is not occupied can be frustrating, but this is where your leadership and positive mindset are essential.

Per our last article, you were tasked to answer the following questions: Where do you want to take your practice? Does everyone around you know? Are you consistent with your team? Do they know the standards that their performance is measured against? Do they know how their contributions contribute to the journey? It is vital for you and your dental team to be on the same page. Just as essential and important is to have a clear mission and purpose. Most of you should have implemented action items to work towards your goals. Please have regularly scheduled meetings to monitor and measure your progress and take the opportunity to celebrate your achievements.

Now let us continue creating the platform for the culture you want. Let's discuss another attribute of a leader - Gratitude. Gratitude is defined as a spontaneous feeling, but research demonstrates its value as a practice. Studies show that people can deliberately cultivate gratitude and there are important social and personal benefits in doing so. This emotion generates a climate of positivity that both reaches inward and extends outward. Are you leading by example? I love the saying; you are a product of your environment. What environment are you creating as a leader? What is something you did today that went above and beyond expectations? Do you treat each team member as if they are the most important person? Did you notice I used the phrase team member and not staff member or employee?

Changing behaviors starts with you! What skills sets are needed? Just as in patient care, listening skills are essential with your team. This skill allows relationships to flourish. The following are some key leadership takeaways: Allow yourself room for grace as you are in a challenging profession. Be gracious and say "thank you" to your team, patients, and colleagues. Many times we think about these words, but we don't say them. Practice saying them often because there is always something to be grateful for. Find appreciation, especially during the most difficult days.

You are judged by how you conduct yourself in times of strife. Unfortunately, our profession has experienced a lot of strife. So where can I get this information? What tools can I get to help me? Reading self-improvement books on topics such as listening skills or active listening are a great resource. Hiring coaches/consultants and studying successful people you admire will provide more insight as well. It would be an interesting exercise if you could watch a video of yourself on a typical day in your practice. What would you see? Would you like what you saw? 

Speaking of grateful, do you know staff appreciation day was March 4th? How did you celebrate this day? Ideally shouldn't we celebrate this every day? Another great resource that I enjoy is the Forbes CXO. This is a great newsletter. Here is an excerpt of an article I enjoyed titled - Employee Appreciation Day: "Imagine if retaining top talent was as easy as saying thank you. It is no silver bullet, but it can easily help. According to a survey of 2000 workers in North America, Ireland, and the UK by a HR tech firm Work human, employees who have been thanked by their managers in the past months are three times as likely to see a future in the company whereas if the employee who are not praised are two times as likely to be seeking employment elsewhere" Startling, isn't it? If you are curious on reading more about positive thinking look up the author Stephen Covey. He is one of my favorites and I enjoy how he puts life in a certain perspective.

Part III of this series will be focusing on teams. We will also have a wonderful opportunity to celebrate your team during our September 15th General Membership meeting. So please save that date and bring your team! We have a lot to celebrate!!! The positive working environment you as a leader create will give your dental team a great place to work as well as a place for your patients to receive the excellent care you and your team provide. If you would like to discuss this topic or any related topics, I would be happy to schedule a call with you. Please email me at dentalstrategies@gmail.com`

    content: `Creating Culture In Today's Dental Offices Part III

I love this topic - TEAM. This next article, part 3 of a 4-part series on Culture, stems from the importance of creating and sustaining great teams. I have witnessed first-hand that when an office has a great team, spirits and productivity are high. I have had the pleasure of coaching the same teams for up to two plus decades and for those who know what I am talking about it is quite special. For those who know what I am talking about, you are fully aware that your personal success directly correlates with how great your team is. The most harmful person on any team to quietly quit is you. As you lead - or check out - your team will follow. When you want a team that shows up on time, be the first person in every day. When you want a team that goes all-in on culture, be the best example of that culture in the best and worst of times.

By now we should have established these definitions, in Part 2. You should have several action items in place. These action items you have experienced may have worked, and some may have failed and some a little bit of both. You, as a leader need to be flexible and navigate through these ebbs and flows of your creation. Your leadership skills - patience, empowerment, positivity, and attitude will dictate the successful course of this journey. So how can this journey be easier? I am a big fan of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). A standard operating procedure is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out routine operations. SOP's aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry standards. So why not make it easier for a team member to be successful. This system is great for a new team member to assimilate to the practice. This is one of many great steps towards creating a great culture! Happy team happy life. 

Here are some sayings and mantras that can build a better team culture. Three words to live by: we before me. When we live them, our patients get the treatment and experience they deserve. When we live them, you and the practice owner develop a culture that all great team members want. When you feel overwhelmed and need help, ask. When you're feeling good and a fellow teammate is overwhelmed, offer to help. When we consistently seek opportunities to make moments just a little better for each other, we grow in gratitude together. When you wake up, ask yourself how can I make each of my team member's life a bit easier today. Break the dichotomy of isolation of the front office, the back office, the RDH - it is our office together! When celebrating a case, celebrate together, all of you. Always check in with each other, try the mirror test. The mirror test is an honest self-reflection of how and what you are doing. This is where a clear definition of culture is important to be able to evaluate yourself for areas to celebrate and areas to improve. My advice is to follow advice that allows you to look at yourself in the mirror and feel proud of the reflection you see. When you can, you're on track. When you can't, forgive yourself and make a change. These are only words unless put into action!!!

Happy New Year! Thank you for the privilege to contribute to our newsletter. In the past 3 articles we covered the following topics:

Part 1 - Leadership
Part 2 - Gratitude
Part 3 - Team

In today's article we will cover Attitude and Mindset. When I think of attitude and mindset, I reflect on the my time serving on the Board of Bellarmine College Prep where both of my sons attended. It was there I learned more about the Jesuits. I particularly appreciated the manner in which Jesuits prayed:

Gratitude: Recall anything from the day for which you are especially grateful and give thanks.
Review: Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from any invitations to grow in love.
Sorrow: Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
Forgiveness: Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
Grace: Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability to see God's presence more clearly.

No matter what your faith is, the above are wonderful steps to follow on a daily basis. These action items will allow one to really appreciate what is truly important. Most practitioners will spend over three decades of their life devoted to the practice of dentistry.

What do you want to be remembered for as a practitioner, leader, employer?
Sometimes in our busy and chaotic lives we often forget to smell the roses. Are you taking time to smell the roses? If you are, good for you!

How are you dealing with the latest challenges?
How are you handling your workforce/team, how are you handling/controlling your overhead, and how are you handling the insurance climate?

These are just a few initiatives I am working with my clients on. However, coaching attitude and mindsets is difficult. You need a person that has a positive attitude, in it to win it attitude, and a spirit of perseverance. It is oftentimes tough to maintain that attitude. What helps are the team, coaches, family, and people around you. In other words: your culture, your environment. It is not if something will happen to affect you and your business, it is when.

Have you conditioned yourself to handle and navigate when these challenges/opportunities present themselves?
With every crisis comes opportunities. Do you believe that?

What do you do to nourish and maintain your attitude and mindsets. When you are at your worst that is when you will be judged. Have you noticed how you are when your whole schedule falls apart compared to the day when you have had an extremely productive day. Your behavior and attitude should be no different. Therefore, there is something to give thanks for even if you are in dire straits, even if your schedule falls apart. Look for the opportunities.

As an industry we have been on a roller coaster since 2020 and we should all be thankful for organized dentistry as we band together to address our next challenges. So these 4 parts: Leadership, Gratitude, Team, and Mindset/Attitude can make up an amazing culture in your dental office for your patients, your team, and yourself. However, this must be a daily purpose and commitment.

I wish you all a wonderful 2023. Be safe, well, and happy.

Thanks to those of you who asked questions, Thanks for those of you who enjoyed the article.

    content: `Debugging the Myths of Practice Transitions/Selling Your Practice Part I

<img src="/lovable-uploads/a5b1b69b-d299-42f1-a481-ba0da951bfa1.png" alt="Professional male dentist in white coat with striped tie smiling in modern dental office" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />

The internet is a wonderful thing. However, everyone should not believe everything on the internet. Nor should you apply everything you read regarding dental practice sales or practice transitions. Practice sales, just like patient care is very personal and should be treated with a customized approach. As with most things, a thoughtful, discerning look at proceeding with something for the first time, something as important as selling/transitioning out of practice should be well thought out, well planned, and well executed!

After my injury, I had the honor to work for the Pride Institute in their transition's department led by Hy Smith, MBA. Hy is an icon at the Pride Institute as well as an expert in transitions. Hy is my mentor and my friend. Hy can be attributed to many various methods of transitions over his 40-year tenure. The days of only being able to do the straight sale: Thursday you sold the practice, Monday the new dentist starts, were over. Sometimes this can result in the dental team feeling shocked and hurt, patients surprised, and a possible exodus of patients. Hy's methodologies, of the "solo group practice", "buy in-buy out", "percentage staggered sale", etc. really allowed our legacies to continue intact and his strategies protected the proceeds of the sale from excessive taxation.

Just like with most things in life, you have several options. Generally, practice transitions are no different. Let's start off by defining what a practice transition is. A practice transition is a process in which you will exit from the practice, which sounds basic enough. However, the complexity of the process is where the art form is in an amazing transition. Many start out with the purchase price. How does one formulate the purchase price? Let's back up a bit. Let's start out with what do you want, how do you want to exit? Ideally you should start thinking about it the minute you purchased a practice or even before.

Myth - I can't think about that, it is so far away.
Myth - I have so much debt I need to pay off first. I also want to buy a home. Most dentists think about this when they want to sell, unfortunately in most instances, they also have been wanting to sell for years but never committed to the process and they have now come to a point that it is now more of an urgency. They are conflicted at the proposition of selling. Why, this is such a big part of one's life, sometimes your identity. The conflict of the joy of caring for patients and wanting to cut back, makes us pause and kick the can down the road.
Myth - You can't cut back; your practice will suffer.
Myth - Hiring an associate to then buy is a disaster.
Myth - By bringing on an associate, your team will then know you are thinking of retiring and leave.

Believe it or not, you can have your cake and eat it too! The cover of the CDA journal about a decade ago reported that at age 65 only 4% of dentists were able to retire in a financially desirable way. Why is that? We are an industry of one of the highest wage earners.

In this year's articles I will focus on Debugging the Myths of Practice Transitions. We will step by step identify and debug the following myths: Retire timeline myth, Valuation myth, and DSO myth.

So, let's start with when you want to exit dentistry, and how? One of the first questions is are you financially prepared to retire. Please consult a financially advisor to help you obtain that answer. Then from there we develop your timeline. I like to position my clients to be financially prepared to retire much earlier than they would like to stop practicing dentistry, ideally 10 years before.

Retirement timeline -
Myth - 65 years old
Myth - Until I cannot practice anymore.

Most of us truly enjoy dentistry and our patients. There are avenues you can still practice as long as you wish, enjoy your patients, impart your knowledge to the next generation, continue your legacy and be financially rewarded. Create a timeline that works for you, then dovetail those desires with your successor. When the next article is published the goal would be for you to have your timeline created so now you can begin the process of treatment planning your transition.

Please let me know if you need assistance with the above exercise. I would also be happy to schedule a call.

Michael Njo of the Practice Transition Institute will also be presenting a seminar at UOP on July 21st, 2023 - "Treatment Plan for Your Transition Into and Out of Practice". Please email me at dentalstrategies@gmail.com`

    content: `Navigating Dental Transitions:
The Importance of Advisors to Ensure a Seamless Process
Written by Practice Transitions Institute

Transitioning a dental practice can be a complex and daunting process. It is one of the most significant career moves a dentist will make. However, with the right advisors/team and a well structured plan, a smooth transition can be achieved. This article will outline the key advisors needed for a dental transition, potential pitfalls to be aware of, and the method employed by the Practice Transitions Institute team, which focuses on a thorough assessment, a customized roadmap, and ongoing guidance to ensure a seamless transition. The goal is to provide a personalized process for the dentist, their patients, dental team, and family.

I. The Advisors Needed for Your Dental Transition

A. Dental Practice Transitions Consultant.
A dental practice transitions consultant plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition process. With their expertise and experience, they evaluate the practice's value, effectively market it, and connect dentists with potential buyers or sellers. Their extensive knowledge of the dental industry and their network of contacts make them invaluable in finding the right match for the practice. They serve as the quarterback of the transition team.

B. Accountant and Financial Advisor.
Engaging the services of a qualified accountant and financial advisor is essential during a dental transition. They assess the practice's financial aspects, analyze tax implications, evaluate profitability, and provide guidance on structuring the deal to maximize financial goals. They also assist in determining the appropriate handling of practice proceeds, ensuring compliance with tax regulations, and minimizing potential tax implications.

C. Legal Counsel.
A Dental transition involves intricate legal procedures, contracts, and negotiations. Hiring a dental-specific attorney can protect the dentist's interests, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and provide guidance on legal matters throughout the transition process. It is vital to follow the guidelines set forth by the state dental board to maintain professional and legal compliance during the transition.

II. Potential Pitfalls to Avoid

A. Lack of Proper Assessment.
Failing to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the dental practice can lead to inaccurate valuations, unrealistic expectations, and potential litigation. A thorough evaluation should include a financial analysis, patient demographics, operational efficiencies, and practice reputation (goodwill) to determine the practice's true value and growth potential. Detailed practice management reports, profit and loss statements, and tax returns must support these metrics. A poorly prepared packet that over or undervalues the practice or is incomplete, will lower the chances of a successful transition.

B. Inadequate Planning and Execution.
Insufficient planning and a lack of a well-defined roadmap can result in a chaotic transition. Without a clear plan in place, important aspects such as patient retention, staff management, and maintaining continuity of care may suffer. Dentists must have a clear understanding of their transition goals and develop a strategic plan to ensure a successful and organized transition process.

C. Failure to Communicate with Stakeholders.
Effective communication is vital during a dental transition. Failing to inform and involve key stakeholders, including patients, staff, and suppliers, can lead to uncertainty, mistrust, and potential disruptions to the practice's operations. Timing is critical in when and how to deliver such information. Dentists must carefully plan and execute a communication strategy that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders and ensures a smooth transition.

III. The Practice Transitions Institute Method

A Seamless Transition with Ongoing Guidance.
At Practice Transitions Institute (PTI), the team understands the intricacies of dental transitions and provides clients with a smooth, seamless, and well-supported experience for clients. PTI's method follows a structured approach.

A. Thorough Assessment.
PTI conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the dental practice, considering financials, operational processes/systems, patient base, goodwill, practice management reports, and growth potential. This thorough assessment serves as the foundation for the transition process, providing vital information that informs the dentist's option and creates a customized "Treatment Plan" with several transition alternatives.

B. Customized Roadmap.
Based on the assessment, PTI develops a tailored roadmap that outlines the necessary steps for a successful transition. This roadmap takes into account the dentist's specific goals, timeline, and individual needs, ensuring a personalized approach that aligns with their objectives.

C. Ongoing Guidance.
Recognizing the overwhelming nature of transitions, PTI's experienced advisors work closely with dentists throughout the process, providing ongoing guidance and support at every stage. Regular communication helps address concerns and ensures that dentists make informed decisions that are in line with their objectives and best interests.

D. Protection from Unforeseen Problems.
Leveraging their expertise, PTI anticipates and mitigates potential issues that may arise during the transition. By proactively identifying and addressing challenges, they strive to protect their client's interests and ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruptions.

E. Holding Your Hand Throughout.
PTI understands the emotional and demanding nature of the transition process. Their dedicated team is committed to supporting dentists, providing reassurance, answering questions, and facilitating a seamless transition that prioritizes patient satisfaction, team satisfaction, personal satisfaction, and peace of mind. Recognizing that knowledge gaps can exist, they aim to educate and guide dentists through the entire process.

Please note that the above overview provides only a glimpse into the benefits of having an organized team and plan. For further insights and information, dentists are invited to join PTI at their transition seminar, Treatment Plan for Your Transition Into and Out of Practice, scheduled for July 21st in San Francisco, at UOP, Dugoni School of Dentistry, and August 18th at the Marriott Phoenix Airport.
